Hello everyone!
I am Bishnupada Sahu currently studying B.Tech in Iter Soa Bhubaneswar. 
This is my web development project i.e. a temperature converter website under Oasis Infobyte.
I thank Oasis Infobyte for giving such a good opportunity to me.

The user will input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a "convert" button. The converted temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit.
Our UI include four main elements:
Input field for the user to type in their temperature - The input is a number!
Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit
"Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion
Display area for the final converted temperature and unit
For an extra challenge: We add a third conversion option to convert from and to Kelvin as well.
